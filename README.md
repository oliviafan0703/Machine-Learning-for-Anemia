Statistical Techniques for Noninvasive Anemia Diagnosis
Description: Blood hemoglobin is an important indicator used for anemia diagnosis, and it is commonly measured by hematology tools in high-income settings. However, such tools are too expensive to be accessible in low- come settings, and the alternative, simpler devices might cause discomfort. This project hopes to develop a mobile application that provides accurate and reliable estimates of hemoglobin levels based on patient nail bed images.
